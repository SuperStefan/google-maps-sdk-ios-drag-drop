google-maps-sdk-ios-drag-drop
=============================
A way to implement the drag &amp; drop functionality in the new Google Maps SDK for iOS.

Please take to notice:
=============================
- Before you can compile the project you have to add YOUR_API_KEY in the AppDelegate.
  The way to receive a key is descriped at: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios/start

- The important class is the GMViewController. The code is well documented and should speak for itself.

- Make a long press on the marker and you can drag the marker arround and set it to another position.
